# RWarriorDamage
Simple World of Warcraft 1.12 Warrior Average DPS Estimation based on current stats and weapon skills assuming constant use of Bloodthirst and Whirlwind. This addon makes swapping items for optimal DPS easy.

# Installation
Requires: "BonusScanner". This addon can be found in many 1.12 packages or here: https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/project-1352/files?filter-game-version=2020709689%3A1 http://www.vanilla-addons.com/dls/bonusscanner/ 

You can download this addon by clicking the green "Clone or download button" up to your right. Once downloaded you will recieve a zipped file, unzip this file to your World Of Warcraft installation path -> Interface -> Addons. If the folder has a trailing "-master" remove this for the addon to function properly.


I appreciate any feedback and suggestions.
